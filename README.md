## Introduction
This project is a web application with both frontend and backend components. It aims to provide user management functionality, including user creation, validation, updating, retrieval, listing, and deletion. The backend is built with Node.js and Express, using MongoDB as the database. The frontend is developed using React.

## Project Structure

### Backend
The backend code is organized into several files:

- **`server.js`**: Sets up the Express server, defines routes, and listens for incoming requests.
- **`router.js`**: Defines the API routes used in the application.
- **`controller.js`**: Contains the logic for handling requests and responding to clients.
- **`service.js`**: Acts as an intermediary between the controller and the model, handling business logic.
- **`model.js`**: Manages interactions with the MongoDB database, including user-related operations.

### Frontend
The frontend is a React application with the following components:

- **`App.js`**: The main component that sets up the application's routes using React Router.
- **`Home.jsx`**: Displays a home page with information about finding passion and dream jobs.
- **`AboutUs.jsx`**: Provides information about the organization's main motto and includes a link to learn more.
- **`Jobs.jsx`**: Displays job listings with details and application links.
- **`Login.jsx`**: Implements a basic login form with validation.
